## Recruitment Tips

### General Strategy

1. **Recruit at level 30** when possible for optimization
2. **Choose job based on primary stat** you want to maximize
3. **Consider secondary stats** especially SPD for most builds
4. **Reset for better rolls** if pursuing perfect characters

### Equipment Considerations

- Recruited characters come with **basic equipment**
- **Weapons**: Lowest-tier weapon for their job
- **Armor**: Leather Clothing, Linen Cuirass, or Hempen Robe
- **Stats shown**: Include equipment bonuses for convenience

### Clan Recruitment

- **"Clan Mates" quest**: Recruit characters of your choice
- **Regional recruitment**: Specific months/regions for different races
- **Stat variance**: Characters can have slightly different stats even from same job
